I am a computational archaeologist (PhD, 2013), geographer (MIS, 2010), field archaeologist (BA, 2008), and philosopher (BA, 2006), who recently returned to graduate school to study computational biology (MSNAS, _expected 2024]_). My interests are broad, and range from geospatial ecology and historical biogeography to socio-ecological systems and epistemology. I am a tinkerer by nature, am _incredibly_ curious, and have always enjoyed taking things apart to see how they work. I am also a champion of open science and reproducible research, and serve that community as an Academic Editor at _[PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/)_, a Review Editor at _[Frontiers in Mammal Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mammal-science)_, and as a moderator at _[SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv)_.
