I am a research archaeologist (PhD, Texas A&M University, 2013) with a deep love of philosophy. I recently returned to graduate school (part-time) to study bioinformatics and computational biology. My interests are broad, and range from predictive modeling (historical biogeography) and the quantitative study of shape change in cultural artefacts (traditional + geometric morphometrics), to data science and engineering. I am a tinkerer by nature, am _incredibly_ curious, and have always enjoyed taking things apart to see how they work.
