I am a computational archaeologist (PhD, Texas A&M University, 2013), geographer (MIS, Stephen F. Austin State University, 2010), field archaeologist (BA, Texas State University, 2008), and philosopher (BA Texas State University, 2006), who recently returned to graduate school—part time—to study computational biology (MSNAS, Stephen F. Austin State Universty, _expected 2024]_). My interests are broad, and range from geospatial ecology and historical biogeography to socio-ecological systems and epistemology. I am a tinkerer by nature, am _incredibly_ curious, and have always enjoyed taking things apart to see how they work. I am also a champion of open access and reproducible research, and serve that community as an Academic Editor at _[PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/)_, a Review Editor at _[Frontiers in Mammal Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mammal-science)_, a moderator at _[SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv)_, and as co-founding editor of the _[Index of Texas Archaeology](https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita/)_.

My current work is aimed at better understanding prehistoric human biogeography and the morphological variation of tools found in the archaeological record. I use data-driven approaches to study how material culture informs the cultural and practical choices made by ancient artisans that resulted in temporal and spatial variation, and how subtle material culture differences support theoretical inferences used to demarcate discrete groups and/or communities. My work is informed by active engagement with the public, as well as Tribal and descendant communities, and fosters an open access and reproducible approach to research that aids in addressing complex anthropological questions, while democratizing my research results.
