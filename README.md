I am a research archaeologist (PhD, Texas A&M University, 2013) with a deep love of philosophy. I recently returned to graduate school (part-time) to study bioinformatics and computational biology. My interests are broad, and range from predictive modeling (historical biogeography) and the quantitative study of shape change in cultural artefacts (traditional + geometric morphometrics), to data science and engineering. I am a tinkerer by nature, am _incredibly_ curious, and have always enjoyed taking things apart to see how they work.

My current work concerns how material culture informs 1) how modern humans and our hominin ancestors crafted raw materials into tools and technologies, 2) the cultural and practical choices made by ancient artisans that resulted in temporal and spatial variation, and 3) how subtle differences in material culture support theoretical inferences used to demarcate discrete communities of practice, while my larger research program is aimed at better understanding historical biogeography and morphological variation in the archaeological record. I see myself as part of an archaeological vanguard that takes advantage of modern methods of shape analysis coupled with data science, statistics, machine learning, big data, GIS, public engagement, and engagement with descendant communities that allows archaeologists to grapple with anthropological questions that were previously out of reach.
