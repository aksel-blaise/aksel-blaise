I am a research archaeologist with a deep love for philosophy (my first degree), and who recently returned to graduate school (part-time) to study bioinformatics and computational biology. My interests are broad, and range from CAD/drafting, GIS, radiocarbon, geochemistry, and the quantitative study of shape change in cultural artefacts, to data engineering and software development. I am a tinkerer by nature, am _incredibly_ curious, and have always enjoyed taking things apart to see how they work. In that capacity, I also feel that I am perpetually trying to find out where those leftover screws are supposed to go when putting everything back together again. That ever happen to you? It happens to me daily...sometimes hourly. Just stick with it. I believe in you!
