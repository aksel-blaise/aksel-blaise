My research interests are broad, and range from safety and injury prevention to socio-ecological systems and historical biogeography. I am a tinkerer by nature, am _incredibly_ curious, and have always enjoyed taking things apart to see how they work. I am also a champion of open science and reproducible research, and serve that community as an Academic Editor at _[PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/)_, a Review Editor at _[Frontiers in Mammal Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mammal-science)_, and as a moderator at _[SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv)_.
